# 👋 Hi, I'm Vinu Varshith  
**SOC Analyst | Blue Team Enthusiast | Cybersecurity Explorer | Researcher**



## 🛡️ About Me

Hey there! I’m Vinu, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong foundation in blue teaming, threat detection, and incident response. I'm passionate about securing digital ecosystems and enjoy diving into logs, analyzing alerts, and building better defenses.

🔍 My focus areas:
- Security Operations Center (SOC) activities
- Threat hunting and log analysis
- SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh)
- IDS/IPS, endpoint monitoring, malware analysis
- Python scripting for automation & data parsing


## 🔬 Projects in Cybersecurity

### Keylogger Detector
Built a Python-based Keylogger Detector with real-time GUI monitoring, manual process termination, and email alerts via Mailtrap.
Simulated attacks using fake keylogger and file modifier scripts to validate detection.

### Cyber Password Toolkit
A web-based application to generate strong passwords and test their strength based on NIST guidelines.
Built with Python (Flask) and JavaScript, featuring a live strength bar and estimated crack time.
Deployed publicly using Render with full HTTPS security.

### SOC Automation Lab
Deployed a cloud-based SOC lab on DigitalOcean using Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle.
Automated alert triage and incident management from Sysmon logs on Windows 11.
Simulated Mimikatz attacks and wrote custom detection rules in Wazuh.

### Home SOC Lab – Splunk + Sysmon with Malware Simulation
Built a SOC lab using VirtualBox with Kali Linux (attacker) and Windows 11 (victim).
Installed Sysmon, forwarded logs to Splunk, and simulated attacks like Nmap scanning and reverse shells.
Captured and analyzed events using Splunk queries with network isolation for safe malware execution.

### Static Malware Analysis – XMoon.exe
Performed static analysis on a suspicious Windows binary (XMoon.exe).
Extracted IOCs using strings, FLOSS, XorSearch, and analyzed PE structure with PEStudio.
Checked reputation and signatures using VirusTotal and identified possible packing.
